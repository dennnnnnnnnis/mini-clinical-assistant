# Research Notes: Medical Coding & Documentation

This document lists the public sources used to understand ICD-10, CPT, and E&M coding basics for implementing the Clinical Assistant application.

## ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision)

### Primary Sources
- **WHO ICD-10 Online Browser** - https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en
  - Official WHO classification system for medical diagnoses

- **CMS ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines** - https://www.cms.gov/medicare/icd-10/2023-icd-10-cm
  - Provides coding rules and examples for proper code assignment

- **AAPC ICD-10 Resources** - https://www.aapc.com/icd-10/
  - Professional coding association resources

### Key Takeaways
- ICD-10 codes are alphanumeric (e.g., I10 for hypertension)
- Codes become more specific with additional characters
- Common categories: I (Circulatory), E (Endocrine), J (Respiratory), Z (Encounters)

## CPT (Current Procedural Terminology)

### Primary Sources
- **AMA CPT Database** - https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/cpt
  - Official CPT codes maintained by American Medical Association
  - Used for understanding procedure and service codes

- **CMS Physician Fee Schedule** - https://www.cms.gov/medicare/physician-fee-schedule
  - Medicare fee schedule with CPT code descriptions
  - Provides context for common office procedures

- **AAPC CPT Code Lookup** - https://www.aapc.com/codes/cpt-codes/
  - Professional resource for CPT code research
  - Examples of proper code usage and documentation requirements

### Key Takeaways
- CPT codes are 5-digit numeric codes (e.g., 99213 for office visit)
- Categories: 99XXX (E&M), 9XXXX (radiology/pathology), others (procedures)
- Level of service determined by complexity and time

## E&M (Evaluation and Management) Coding

### Primary Sources
- **CMS E&M Guidelines 2021** - https://www.cms.gov/outreach-and-education/medicare-learning-network-mln/mlnproducts/downloads/eval-mgmt-serv-guide-ice.pdf
  - Official guidelines for E&M coding
  - Documentation requirements and level determination

- **AMA E&M Documentation Guidelines** - https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2019-06/cpt-office-prolonged-svs-code-changes.pdf
  - Professional standards for E&M services
  - Time-based vs. medical decision making criteria

- **Family Practice Management E&M Guide** - https://www.aafp.org/fpm/2019/0900/p6.html
  - Practical examples of E&M level determination
  - Real-world coding scenarios and documentation

### Key Takeaways
- E&M levels range from 99211-99215 for established patients
- 2021+ guidelines emphasize medical decision making or time
- Documentation must support the level of service billed
