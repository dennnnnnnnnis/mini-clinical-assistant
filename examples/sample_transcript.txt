Doctor: Hi, what brings you in today?
Patient: I've had a cough for the past two weeks, and it hasn't gone away.
Doctor: Is the cough dry or are you producing mucus?
Patient: It's mostly dry. Sometimes I feel a bit of tightness in my chest.
Doctor: Any fever, chills, or shortness of breath?
Patient: No fever or chills, but I do get short of breath when climbing stairs.
Doctor: Do you have any history of asthma, allergies, or smoking?
Patient: I have seasonal allergies, but I've never smoked.
Doctor: Any other medical conditions or medications?
Patient: I take antihistamines occasionally, but that's it.
Doctor: Thanks. I'll listen to your lungs. [Exam performed] Lungs sound clear, no wheezing.
Doctor: Based on what you're telling me and my exam, this seems like it could be related to your seasonal allergies, possibly post-nasal drip causing the cough. The shortness of breath with exertion is concerning though.
Patient: What do you think we should do?
Doctor: I'd like to start you on a nasal steroid spray and a cough suppressant. Let's also get a chest X-ray to make sure everything looks normal. If symptoms don't improve in a week, we'll reassess.
Patient: That sounds good. How long should I use the nasal spray?
Doctor: Start with two weeks, and we can adjust based on how you respond. Any questions about the treatment plan?
Patient: No, I think that covers it. Thank you.
