Doctor: What brings you in today?
Patient: I’ve had lower back pain for about 3 weeks now.
Doctor: Did anything trigger it? Injury or heavy lifting?
Patient: I think it started after moving some boxes.
Doctor: How would you describe the pain?
Patient: It’s a dull ache, worse when I sit for too long.
Doctor: Any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs?
Patient: No, nothing like that.
Doctor: Have you tried anything for relief?
Patient: Just some over-the-counter ibuprofen. It helps a little.
Doctor: Okay, sounds like mechanical low back pain. Let’s discuss posture, stretching, and maybe physiotherapy.
